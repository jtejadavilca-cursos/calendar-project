# CALENDAR PROJECT

This project was created on ReactJS course from Fernando Herrera. It contains both backend and frontend side. [The frontend side](./calendar-webapp/README.md) has ReactJS and [the backend side](./calendar-backend/README.md) was created using NestJS (and it was not following the course). It has also a [docker-compose.yml](./calendar-backend/docker-compose.yml) file in order to build the necesary database (MongoDB) by backend project.
